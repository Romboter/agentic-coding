Based on our discussion, create a new markdown file called DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md that contains the following:

- An overview of the goal and objectives along with any important background information.
- A list of hard requirements if we have defined any.
- Any unknowns or assumptions (if applicable).
- If you are unsure of the agreed direction for development, you can use the `ask_followup_question` tool to clarify.
- A break down the development requirements into a checklist of tasks to be completed in phases.
- You do not need to include dates or time estimates.
- Each task should be a checklist item.
- The document should be written in a way that I can provide it to a senior AI coding agent and have them understand and carry out the development.
- Use dashes and a single space for markdown lists.

For example:

## Phase 1

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

Then stop, and I will review the plan.
